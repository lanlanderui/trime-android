/**
 * Which schema switches the menu shows, and in what shape.
 *
 * The shape matters beyond the label: a switch that carries `options` is the one whose states the
 * menu has to offer as a list, and that list is what used to tear the window down (see
 * `SwitchOptionWindow`). Keeping the rule under test is what keeps that path visible.
