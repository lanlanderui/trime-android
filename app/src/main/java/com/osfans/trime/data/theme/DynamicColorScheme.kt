/**
 * The built-in "dynamic" colour scheme, derived from the Material You palettes the system
 * generates from the user's wallpaper (`android.R.color.system_accent*` and
 * `android.R.color.system_neutral*`).
 *
 * It deliberately is *not* a theme preset. [Theme.colorSchemes] only ever holds what
 * `preset_color_schemes` declares, so this scheme is appended to the selectable list at the
 * point of use (see [ColorManager.availableColorSchemes]) under the reserved id [ID]. That way
 * a theme can define whatever schemes it likes without hiding the dynamic one — and, because
 * the id is reserved, without shadowing it either.
 *
 * Two things set it apart from a theme scheme, both of them consequences of the same fact — it
 * is the *app* that owns the palette, not the theme author:
 *
 * 1. It is layered over a theme scheme rather than standing alone. A theme may name colour keys
 *    of its own and bind them per key in its keyboards — the 同文风 theme paints shift,
 *    backspace, return and space with `bgn`, `bbs`, `benter` and `bkg` — and a scheme that
 *    knows nothing about those names leaves the references resolving to nothing.
 * 2. Keys are painted by *kind* rather than through the theme's colour keys: everything that is
 *    not a letter key or the space bar is a function key and takes the same tint (the
 *    `off_key_*` family below, an accent tint rather than another neutral step, so that it reads
 *    as a group next to the letter keys). The theme cannot bind a colour to a key its author
 *    never saw, so this is the only rule that also covers a key the user adds to a custom layout.
 *    The keys sit in [KeyPalette] and the call site in `Key`.
 *
 * The system palettes exist from Android 12 on, so [isSupported] gates every entry point.

 * Android resources behind [DynamicColorScheme.systemColor].
 *
 * The tones are not free invention. They were read back from the Material You scheme the

 * by matching each of its colours against the system palettes on (L\*, C\*): that identifies tone
 * and palette family without knowing the wallpaper the hue came from. What it showed is the
 * ladder below — in particular that this scheme had been a tone too dark on every neutral role in
 * the day state, and that the function keys want *chroma*, not just a lighter neutral (see
 * [palette]'s function keys).
 *
 * The three key families are what the scheme is about:
 *
 * - `key_*` — the letter keys and the space bar, plus the chrome around them.
 * - `off_key_*` — *every* function key. Not "the keys the theme marked `functional`": the theme
 *   is not consulted at all, and the call site in `Key` routes every key that is neither a letter
 *   nor the space bar here.
 * - `on_key_*` — a key that is currently toggled on (shift held, caps on), which gets the solid
 *   primary colour: a stronger signal than either idle state, and one the `hilited_*` family can
 *   still deepen.
